# Plant-It-Automatic-Watering-System
Plant-It is an ESP8266-based smart watering controller: snap a plant photo, identify it via Pl@ntNet, use OpenAI to set its ideal moisture range, then auto-water based on JSON-driven thresholds. Wi-Fi connectivity links to a web dashboard for live monitoring and I2C LCD feedback.
